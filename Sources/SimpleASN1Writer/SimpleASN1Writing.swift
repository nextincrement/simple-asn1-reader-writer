/// The `SimpleASN1Writing` protocol describes how a DER encoding can be created or updated by
/// inserting bytes on top of bytes that have been written before.
///
/// Simple in this context means:
/// - No conversion between Swift data types and bytes (so, only bytes in)
/// - No high tag numbers (that is, tag numbers are encoded by a single byte)
/// - No support for encodings that have an indefinite length
/// - No writing to an underlying `Stream`
///
/// Note that this protocol is designed in a way that multiple instances of an implementation should
/// be created if the encoding has a tree-like structure that forks into multiple branches.
public protocol SimpleASN1Writing: AnyObject {

  /// All encoded bytes added to this writer.
  var encoding: [UInt8] { get }

  /// Convenience method that adds the encoding of another instance to the current instance. All
  /// bytes of the `SimpleASN1Writer` will be written on top of bytes written below (as a sibling).
  ///
  /// - Parameter from: Another instance of a class implementing this protocol
  func writeBytes(from writer: SimpleASN1Writer)

  /// Writes bytes on top of all bytes written below (as a sibling).
  ///
  /// - Parameter bytes: Bytes that will be written on top of bytes below
  func writeBytes(_ bytes: [UInt8])

  /// Writes contents, length and identifier bytes, in that particular order, on top of all bytes
  /// written below. The number represented by the length bytes applies to the number of contents
  /// bytes of the added component.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - contents: Contents bytes of the component
  ///   - identifiedBy: ASN.1 identifier of the component
  func writeContents(_ contents: [UInt8], identifiedBy expectedIdentifier: UInt8)

  /// Writes length and identifier bytes, in that particular order, to wrap all bytes written below.
  ///
  /// - Parameter identifier: ASN.1 identifier byte that will be written on top of length bytes and
  /// bytes below
  func writeLengthAndIdentifier(_ identifier: UInt8)

  /// Convenience method that writes length and identifier bytes of a bit string, in that particular
  /// order, to wrap all bytes written below. The bit string is assumed to have no unused bits (that
  /// is, the fist contents byte has value 0x00).
